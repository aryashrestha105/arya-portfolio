# Myopia

Traffic headlights in the distance  
blurred because of my damned eyesight  
Are they too close for me to cross the road  
or far away, rushing towards me?  

I glare back at the blinding lights (lol)  
My eyesight has deteriorated in recent years  
But really, Iâ€™ve always been bad  
at looking far ahead  

Would it be poetic coincidence  
or a twisted joke at my expense  
that my inability to think about the future  
is what cursed me  
into needing to put on  
two pairs of glasses in cinema halls?
