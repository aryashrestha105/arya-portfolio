# Limitations on Art

I know some people  
who call art ‘pretentious’  
Which I think is incredibly classist  
Do you think regular people  
don’t indulge in art?  
Art keeps us all going  
Passion and creativity keep us going  
often in the form of Music and Cinema  

Some people also try to define, and fit art  
Into their little, limiting niches  

Some people think art cannot be simple  
Why would art always need to be complex  
Isn’t minimalism beautiful in its own way?  

Who really decides what art is  
Is it the creator? Is it the viewer?  
Is it the emotions and meaning behind it,  
Is it the emotions and meaning it instigates?  

Does it need to have emotion and meaning  
In the first place? Does beauty not exist  
Simply in the aesthetics of the form?  

If the creator doesn’t deem their work as art  
Would it still be art? Or is it up to its viewers?  
Is the original meaning behind art  
The only real interpretation of it?  
Or are other interpretations still valid?  

I think art is like Love, and all other emotions  
There’s really no logic or sense behind it  
I believe that art can be anything, really  
Anything that can inspire, and can be pretty  
Any creation of mankind, and of nature  

Sand castles made by kids  
Brilliant Bangalore sunsets  
Towering skyscrapers  
Snowy Himalayan mountains  
Imaginative Video games  
Serene river valleys  

The subjective opinion is really  
What makes ‘good’ art?  
That, however, is an entirely different poem
