# The Titan Sub Fiasco: All You Need To Know

July 5th, 2024

On June 18th, Titan, a deep-diving submersible, lost contact with its mothership, leading to a globally publicized and broadcasted, round-the-clock search and rescue movement by the US and Canadian coast guards.

After being missing for four days, pieces of its wreckage were found on the ocean floor on June 22nd. Leading experts believe that the submersible catastrophically imploded under the intense water pressure when it lost communications, instantly killing all five on board. The ‘experimental’ sub was operated by Oceangate, a private expedition/tourism company, to view the wreckage of the famously ill-fated RMS Titanic in the North-Atlantic ocean near Canada’s coastline, with the company’s CEO, Stockton Rush, also onboard. Other notable passengers were Shahzada Dawood, a Pakistani billionaire along with his son, and Hamish Harding- a British billionaire.

There were several safety concerns with the sub, as the CEO himself refused to get it certified according to industry standards, citing that he was ‘breaking the rules for the sake of innovation.’ He employed several dangerous cost-cutting techniques, such as constructing the cylindrical body out of carbon composites, an unsuitable material for resisting external pressure, using acrylic glass rated for far less than the depths the sub was going to, inadequate communications systems, and using a third-party AA battery-powered Bluetooth controller for the steering.
