            <TextParagraph text="The Moon. The Sun. Other planets. Aliens. Stars. Constellations. Galaxies. The universe. Multiverses." />
            <TextParagraph text="These topics have fascinated people for centuries, and it’s easy to see why. Space represents many ideas and themes, and its endless vastness gives creative artists so much freedom in constructing and crafting vibrant and diverse narratives, stories, characters, settings and aesthetics." />
            <TextParagraph text="From the mythologies of the olden days, stories like the constellations being placed in the night sky by the Greek gods to honour and represent different events in Greek mythology, to the Northern lights being reflections from the shields of Norse Valkyries, which were female warriors of Valhalla (the Nordic afterlife); stories around space have always had vivid portrayals." />
            <TextParagraph text="Naturally, the topic of space is wildly popular. But for those not affiliated with rocket scientists, (ie. most people) the closest they can get to outer space is engaging with its stories, or through pop culture. It’s like Jurassic Park for the kids obsessed with dinosaurs (it’s me. I was the dinosaur kid)." />
            <TextParagraph text="Today, popular culture (or modern-day myths) have countless science-fiction stories set in outer space, with several of them being widely acclaimed and celebrated, such as Interstellar, The Martian, Alien (1979), WALL-E, Star Wars, Star Trek, The Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, Cowboy Bebop, and Mass Effect." />
            <TextParagraph text="If you recognise the titles I’ve mentioned, you’ll see that space isn’t confined by any genre, given that the stories here range from action/comedy flicks to epic sagas, from kid-friendly animation to horror. It can be just the backdrop to a story of survival about a spaceship infested by a killer alien, to the theme for a Christopher Nolan movie revolving around space-time and human exploration." />
            <TextParagraph text="It’s said that the sky’s the limit for human imagination, and when it comes to outer space, that restriction becomes limitless. With fictional stories set in space, there’s just so much variety you could include and incorporate. Stories set on advanced spaceships, stories set on alien planets with all kinds of plants and animals (if you can even call them that), stories with aliens, and how they look, think, and act completely alien (Heh) from what we see on our own planet. It also presents a compelling contrast in scale – with the magnitude of planets and galaxies, and the relatively insignificant sizes of the characters; which can be used to portray either loneliness or the exciting expanse of outer space to be explored. Science fiction revolving around outer space really has the highest degree of escapism possible." />
            <TextParagraph text="Space has always captivated the collective human imagination and consciousness, and will continue to do so, even if (or when) humanity finds itself spread out among the stars. Even beyond just narratives, outer space has inspired and influenced renowned works of music (David Bowie’s ‘Space Oddity’ and ‘Starman’), art, fashion and design (think metallic fabric, NASA-inspired minimalist and sleek aesthetics) and more recently, space tourism (which is probably a pipe dream for the likes of you and I) but just imagine- a little bit of sci-fi wouldn’t remain fictional any longer for people of the future generations, as our tech gets better and better." />
            <TextParagraph text="Who knows, maybe humanity will get to live out some of its fictional stories someday. Let’s just hope it’s not like the ones with murderous aliens, shall we?" />
