            <br></br>
            <TextParagraph text="Let me guess- you read the headline, thought of the movie Adipurush, and immediately disagreed, didn’t you?" />
            <TextParagraph text="Some of you must have heard of the Percy Jackson series, the God of War games, and of course, the portrayal of the Nordic gods in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. These hugely successful franchises revolve around Greek and Norse mythology, but with several artistic liberties taken. (And not a lot of controversy around them, mind you.)" />
            <TextParagraph text="Mythology, by definition, is a collection of stories passed down to people belonging to specific cultural traditions. And stories, by their nature, can never remain static. What we deem to be the “correct” interpretation of a specific mythological event in the present day may not be what the original story used to be, or what other people believe in." />
            <TextParagraph text="For example, let’s take Ramayana- the oldest version of the epic is attributed to the sage Narada, who passed this knowledge on to Valmiki, who then authored the sequence of events that most of us are familiar with. Later on, the story spread through the Indian subcontinent and eventually gained several regional variations. It even spread to countries like Thailand, Japan, Laos, Cambodia, and Indonesia, all with their own twists and reinterpretations on the Indian epic, but nonetheless passed down through generations and generations via oral traditions and other storytelling methods." />
            <TextParagraph text="Would you tell the people of those countries that their version of the story is “wrong” and ours is “correct” just because it came from here first?" />
            <TextParagraph text="I’ve seen massive statues of Rama and Garuda in Indonesia and several Hindu shrines and temples in Thailand. The devotion and respect their people have for these mythological figures is genuine; far more important than chasing after and adhering to strict standards for what the story should be like, in my opinion." />
            <TextParagraph text="Coming to modern adaptations, Amish Tripathi has written the Ram Chandra novels, which is a complete reimagination of the original story, using the same characters and sequence of events, but containing fresh perspectives, realistic sensibilities, philosophical debates, and fleshed-out characterizations. I wouldn’t call it genre-defining literature or anything, but it is a fun read, and a decent introduction to the myths themself, because even with all the changes made to the story, you can tell that the author respects the mythological figures for who they are." />
            <TextParagraph text="Naturally, when people go around changing stories (and making up entirely new ones) there will always be good stories and bad stories, and that’s why I think it’s pretty unfair to categorise all reinterpretations of mythology into the same category as something like Adipurush." />
            <TextParagraph text="Personally, I would always want to see different perspectives, takes and spins on the old stories instead of just rehashing the same old plots that have been done in the media over and over." />
            <TextParagraph text="Of course, things get tricky when religious sentiments get involved, but I believe that people should view these stories with more of an open mind, and not necessarily for a bullet list of plot points. I sincerely believe if reinterpretations are made while respecting the original stories, then they usually turn out to be stories worth (re)experiencing." />
