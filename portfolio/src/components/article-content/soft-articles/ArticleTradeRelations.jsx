            <BoldHeading text="How Trade Relations Play A Role In Ensuring International Peace"/>
            <br></br>
            <TextParagraph text="“No two countries that both have a McDonald’s have ever fought a war against each other.” Stated by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, in his “Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention”, he claims that countries which are financially successful enough to attract the massive American fast-food company can never go to war with another country also having the presence of the aforementioned golden arches, so to speak." />
            <TextParagraph text="This exact theory has been proved wrong on several instances since then, but it is irrefutable that economic globalization has led to a tighter-knit international community and less conflict between developed countries. International trade relations in the modern day are essential to understanding how global geopolitics work on a fundamental level, and extremely important in preventing conflicts and maintaining peace." />
            <TextParagraph text="It is a common viewpoint held between economists (and perhaps the only one) that a nation is always better off when it trades with another. It also ensures that states which are trading partners exercise utmost caution in provoking each other, as they become financially linked to each other. These economic ties also create a vested interest in the prosperity, stability, and growth of their trading partners." />
            <TextParagraph text="It’s why America has strong diplomatic relations with Japan and Vietnam in the modern day, despite having been bitter enemies decades ago." />
            <TextParagraph text="It’s why China, for all the saber-rattling their autocratic government likes to do, will never engage in all-out war- because their economy is completely dependent on other countries." />
            <TextParagraph text="It’s why there hasn’t been any major conflicts in western and central Europe in the modern times, as the European Union member-states have become economically interdependent to each other through the creation of a single market and the reduction of trade barriers." />
            <TextParagraph text="It’s why Taiwan hasn’t been subjugated by China yet, given that the rest of the world is reliant on the small country for their semiconductors, which power all existing electronics globally." />
            <TextParagraph text="Unfortunately, war and conflict still exist, in one way or the other (the recent Israel-Palestine war, for example), but globalization and trade channels have served as a solid foundation for furthering diplomatic relations and have contributed to lasting peace for the majority of the international community." />
