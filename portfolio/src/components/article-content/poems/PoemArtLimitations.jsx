            <TextParagraph text={`If the creator doesn’t deem their work as art\nWould it still be art? Or is it up to its viewers?\nIs the original meaning behind art\nThe only real interpretation of it?\nOr are other interpretations still valid?`} />
            <TextParagraph text={`I think art is like Love, and all other emotions\nThere’s really no logic or sense behind it\nI believe that art can be anything, really\nAnything that can inspire, and can be pretty\nAny creation of mankind, and of nature`} />
